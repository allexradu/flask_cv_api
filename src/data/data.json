This software has an easy to use interface in Microsoft Excel that\nemployees can use to easily recreate the steps taken by a human to enter orders in the ERP software and export stocks and prices to be imported in the Contentspeed Platform.This software has halved\nthe implementation time of a RPA Integration.",
          "I've developed DOWNIMG.GA a website that greatly eases the work of my colleagues in the\nimplementation department by allowing them to quickly batch download images using an excel\nimport file and that file will be ready to import products into our Contentspeed eCommerce\nPlatform. It also allows them to split Excel Files and match keys and values to rows and columns,\ngreatly reducing their time processing excel files. For this project I've used Python, Django, Celery,\nRedis, Docker on the backednd and Javascript, HTML, Bootstrap on the frontend.",
